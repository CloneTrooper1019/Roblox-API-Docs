# Members

## Coils
The number of coils in the in-game visual. Value in [0, 8].

## CurrentLength
Current distance between the two attachments. Value in [0, inf).

## Damping
The damping parameter of the spring. The force is scaled with respect to relative velocity. The units of this property are force / velocity. Value in [0, inf).

## FreeLength
The distance (in studs) between the two attachments at which the spring exerts no stiffness force. Value in [0, inf).

## LimitsEnabled
Enables limits on the length of the spring.

## MaxForce
The maximum force that the spring can apply. Useful to prevent instabilities. The units are mass * studs / seconds^2. Value in [0, inf).

## MaxLength
Maximum spring length, or the maxium distance between the two attachments. Value in [0, inf).

## MinLength
Minimum spring length, or the minimum distance between the two attachments. Value in [0, inf).

## Radius
The radius of the in-game spring coil visual. Value in [0, inf).

## Stiffness
The stiffness parameter of the spring. Force is scaled based on distance from the free length. The units of this property are force / distance. Value in [0, inf).

## Thickness
The thickness of the spring wire (diameter) in the in-game visual. Value in [0, inf).
