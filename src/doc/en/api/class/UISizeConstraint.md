# Summary
Ensures a GuiObject does not become smaller or larger than the min and max size. If an element with a constraint is under the control of a layout, the constraint takes precedence in determining the elementâ€™s size, but not position. You can use a Constraint by parenting it to the element you wish to constrain.

# Members
