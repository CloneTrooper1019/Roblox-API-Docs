# Summary
Ensures a GuiObject with text does not allow the font size to become larger or smaller than min and max text sizes. If an element with a constraint is under the control of a layout, the constraint takes precedence in determining the elementâ€™s size, but not position. You can use a Constraint by parenting it to the element you wish to constrain.
